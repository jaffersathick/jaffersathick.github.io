Designer

Just a simple indian girl who loves to create awesome lovable stuffs—
I always aim for simple, effective, efficient and most of all user friendly solutions that will work for the betterment of the intended users.
The last few years have seen me work my way up from a graphic designer to UX designer, managing a team.

Creating User Experiences, Designing and Developing User Interfaces for web and mobile applicalions is what i do.
I love what I do, actually I choose what I love to do.
I trust on UX research and simple design to create incredibly easy, efficient, effective and satisfying to use products which influence users rather than eye catching design alone.
I especially enjoy understanding user behavior and being able to take that information to design delightful experiences.
